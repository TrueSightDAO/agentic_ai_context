SunMint Program Design Document (PDD)


Project Title: SunMint
Project Proponent: TrueSight DAO / Agroverse InitiativeProject Type: Reforestation and Agroforestry-Based Carbon SequestrationRegions: Amazon and Atlantic Rainforests, BrazilProject Duration: 30 years (renewable crediting period)


1. Project Description
SunMint is a regenerative finance (ReFi) initiative under TrueSight DAO’s Agroverse program. It partners with small-scale farmers and Indigenous communities in Brazil’s Amazon and Atlantic rainforests to restore degraded lands through sustainable agroforestry—primarily via cacao cultivation. By financing upfront costs and verifying on-the-ground actions, SunMint enables participants to transition away from extractive practices toward nature-positive livelihoods, generating certified carbon credits along the way.


TrueSight DAO is founded with the purpose of building a better world based on compassion. Our core values are mindfulness, compassion, and equanimity.


2. Purpose and Objectives
* Restore degraded lands and increase carbon sequestration through agroforestry
* Improve local livelihoods by providing upfront financing and long-term revenue through carbon credits and cacao exports
* Promote biodiversity, soil health, and ecosystem regeneration
* Re-integrate Indigenous knowledge and cultural practices into land stewardship
* Establish transparent, digital MRV systems using decentralized technology


3. Project Boundary
* Geographic Scope: Select parcels within Brazil’s Amazon and Atlantic Rainforests
* Temporal Scope: 30 years, with ongoing monitoring and periodic verification
* Carbon Pools Considered: Aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, soil organic carbon


4. Baseline Scenario
The baseline condition reflects continued degradation from cattle ranching and monoculture soybean farming, leading to biodiversity loss, GHG emissions, and disrupted ecosystems. Without intervention, these lands are unlikely to recover naturally due to lack of financial incentives and entrenched economic pressures.


5. Additionality
Small-scale farmers and Indigenous communities face a major barrier: cacao trees take ~1.5 years to bear fruit, creating a gap in income. Without financial and technical support, transitioning to agroforestry is not feasible. SunMint overcomes this through:
* Upfront financing and DAO-based benefit sharing
* Long-term cacao buyer partnerships
* On-chain MRV tools that streamline carbon certification


6. Project Activities
Site Selection & Preparation
* Conduct feasibility studies on land use rights and logistics
* Environmental impact assessments and permitting
* Prepare land with biodiversity-sensitive restoration strategies
Agroforestry Implementation
* Plant cacao trees with native support species
* Install water access and irrigation systems
* Apply organic, regenerative practices and integrated pest management
Carbon Credit Development
* Apply relevant methodologies (e.g., Verra VM0017, ARR)
* Quantify sequestration via biomass surveys and soil sampling
* Submit for third-party validation and registry certification
Cacao Production and Export
* Harvest and sell cacao beans to ethical chocolate makers
* Create marketing around social and environmental impact
* Secure offtake agreements for price stability
Monitoring & Evaluation
* Establish plots and satellite-based tracking
* Regular soil, biomass, and biodiversity sampling
* Social and environmental impact assessments
Community Engagement
* Partner with Indigenous and local farming communities
* Implement participatory governance via TrueSight DAO
* Provide training and ongoing capacity-building


7. Traceability and Digital Verification
All project activities are logged and verified via open-access, on-chain tools:
* Farm Registration:
https://dapp.truesight.me/register_farm.html
* Tree Planting Reporting:
https://dapp.truesight.me/report_tree_planting.html
* Public Registries:
   * Farms Registry
   * Trees Registry
Each record includes:
   * Timestamped evidence
   * Farmer identity and location
   * Photos and optional GPS metadata
   * Public auditability to reduce fraud risk
8. GHG Emissions Reduction Estimation
Estimates to be finalized with baseline data and methodology selection.
   * Expected sequestration: X tCO₂e per hectare per year
   * Initial project area: Y hectares
   * Total expected reduction: X × Y tCO₂e annually
9. Leakage
To prevent displacement of deforestation activities:
   * Target already-degraded lands (not pristine forests)
   * Engage communities with sustainable income alternatives
   * Monitor surrounding regions for indirect land use change


10. Environmental and Social Safeguards
   * Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) with Indigenous communities
   * No forced or child labor
   * Equal access and benefit-sharing for all genders
   * Grievance redress channels
   * Biodiversity conservation zones integrated into farm design


11. Risk Assessment and Mitigation
Risk
	Mitigation
	Drought/Climate Events
	Use resilient native species; establish water harvesting systems
	Market volatility for cacao
	Long-term contracts and diversified buyers
	Political/regulatory instability
	Align with local NGOs; legally recognized farmer cooperatives
	Verification delays
	Use real-time on-chain verification tools to streamline certification
	

12. Scaling and Replication Strategy
Following pilot validation, SunMint aims to:
   * Expand to 10,000+ hectares across Amazon and Atlantic regions
   * Replicate in other tropical forest regions (e.g., Congo Basin, Southeast Asia)
   * Offer on-chain carbon credit issuance and transparent benefit sharing via DAO governance
