# CLI Sales Event Audit & Alignment Plan

## Context

Audit of `dapp.truesight.me/report_sales.html` vs `truesight-dao-report-sales` CLI vs `edgar.truesight.me` docs revealed gaps:

### DApp payload (actual)
```
[SALES EVENT]
- Item: {qr_code}
- Sales price: ${amount}
- Sold by: {manager_name}
- Cash proceeds collected by: {cash_name}
- Owner email: {email}
- Stripe Session ID: {id or (none)}
- Shipping Provider: {provider or (none)}
- Tracking number: {tracking or (none)}
- Attached Filename: {filename or None}
- Submission Source: {url}
--------
```

### CLI current
```
[SALES EVENT]
- Item: {free_text_product_description}
- Sales price: ${amount}
- Sold by: {free_text}
- Cash proceeds collected by: {free_text}
- Submission Source: {free_text}
--------
```

### Edgar docs (stale)
```
[SALES EVENT] - QR Code: ... - Buyer Name: ... - Buyer Email: ... - Amount: ... - Currency: USD
```

### Gaps
1. **`Owner email`** — CLI has it as optional `--owner-email`; DApp always sends it. Should be required.
2. **`Item`** — CLI uses free-text product description; DApp uses QR code ID. Should accept `--qr-code` as primary.
3. **`Stripe Session ID`**, **`Shipping Provider`**, **`Tracking number`**, **`Attached Filename`** — missing from CLI entirely.
4. **`Sold by` / `Cash proceeds collected by`** — CLI accepts free-text; DApp pulls from GAS `list_with_members` (Column U = Manager Name in Agroverse QR codes sheet). CLI should validate or at least document the source.
5. **Edgar docs** — show `Buyer Name`/`Buyer Email`/`Amount`/`Currency` which don't match what the DApp actually sends.

## Sequenced PRs

### PR 1: Update CLI `report_sales` module

**Scope:** `dao_client` repo — `truesight_dao_client/modules/report_sales.py`

Changes:
- Add `--qr-code` as primary item identifier (maps to `Item` in payload)
- Make `--owner-email` required (was optional)
- Add optional `--stripe-session-id`, `--shipping-provider`, `--tracking-number`
- Add optional `--attached-filename`
- Default `--submission-source` to `CLI` if not provided
- Keep backward compat: `--item` still works but logs deprecation warning if used without `--qr-code`
- Update `--help` to show all fields matching DApp

**Gate:** PR merged + deployed to PyPI

### PR 2: Update Edgar docs page

**Scope:** `dapp_beta` repo — the `edgar.truesight.me` docs page

Changes:
- Replace stale `[SALES EVENT] - QR Code: ... - Buyer Name: ... - Buyer Email: ... - Amount: ... - Currency: USD` with actual DApp format
- Show the real payload: `Item`, `Sales price`, `Sold by`, `Cash proceeds collected by`, `Owner email`, etc.
- Note that `Stripe Session ID`, `Shipping Provider`, `Tracking number` are optional

**Gate:** PR merged + deployed to beta, reviewed, then promoted to prod

### PR 3: Re-submit Gergana's sale with correct format

**Status:** ~~Skipped~~ — Already handled by governor. No re-submission needed.

~~After PRs 1+2 are live, re-submit:~~

## Progress Log

| Step | Status | Commit / Detail |

| PyPI workflow | ✅ Merged | `f5a97f5` — trusted publishing workflow + v0.2.0 bump |
| Inventory/ledger validators | ✅ Merged | `inventory_item`, `manager_name`, `ledger_name` from treasury-cache |

## Acceptance

- [x] PR 1 merged: CLI accepts all DApp fields, `--owner-email` required
- [x] PR 2 merged: Edgar docs show correct payload format
- [x] PR 3: ~~Gergana's sale re-submitted~~ — Already handled, no action needed
- [ ] Contribution reported for the work

## Remaining Blocker

- **PyPI publish**: The GitHub Actions workflow is configured but needs the `PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret added to the TrueSightDAO/dao_protocol repo Settings → Secrets → Actions. Once set, triggering the workflow will publish v0.2.0.
- Alternative: Install from source via `pip install -e .` in the repo.

## Handoff to Sophia

@sophia-truesight — all code changes are merged to `dao_protocol#main`. PR 3 (Gergana's sale) was already handled by the governor and does not need re-submission.

**Remaining for you:**
1. **PyPI secret configuration** → Add `PYPI_API_TOKEN` to GitHub repo secrets → trigger publish → verify `pip install truesight-dao-client` gets v0.2.0
2. **Contribution reporting** → Report this work via `truesight-dao-report-contribution` (include PRs: `39699cb`, `429aea6`, `531d3da`, `f5a97f5`)

See `dao_protocol` repo for full diff.
