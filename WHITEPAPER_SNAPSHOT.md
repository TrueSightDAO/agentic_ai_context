## Status

This snapshot file is a **placeholder**. The whitepaper content lives in the Google Doc above; governance and project narrative are in that document.

To **refresh this snapshot** with the full doc content:

1. **Run the fetch script** (with credentials if the doc is private):
   ```bash
   cd agentic_ai_context/scripts
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python fetch_whitepaper.py -o ../WHITEPAPER_SNAPSHOT.md
   ```
   If the doc is "Anyone with the link can view", the script may work without credentials. Otherwise set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` or pass `--credentials /path/to/service-account.json` (the service account must have access to the doc).

2. **Or use a browser:** Open [https://truesight.me/whitepaper](https://truesight.me/whitepaper), let it redirect, copy the visible text, and paste below (replacing this placeholder).
