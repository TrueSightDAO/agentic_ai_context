# GitHub SSH — dedicated key for Agentic AI (`git push`)

This workspace uses a **separate Ed25519 key** for automated or agent-driven `git push` to GitHub, so your personal SSH key and day-to-day identity stay untouched.

## Paths (this machine)

| | Path |
|--|------|
| **Directory** | `/Users/garyjob/.ssh/agentic_ai_github/` |
| **Private key** | `/Users/garyjob/.ssh/agentic_ai_github/id_ed25519` |
| **Public key** | `/Users/garyjob/.ssh/agentic_ai_github/id_ed25519.pub` |

Portable form: **`$HOME/.ssh/agentic_ai_github/id_ed25519`** (and `.pub`).

**Rules**

- **Never** commit the **private** key into any repository (including `agentic_ai_context`).
- Permissions: directory `700`, private key `600`, public key `644`.

## One-time: add the public key to GitHub

1. Show the public key:  
   `cat ~/.ssh/agentic_ai_github/id_ed25519.pub`
2. GitHub → **Settings** → **SSH and GPG keys** → **New SSH key**  
   - Title e.g. `Agentic AI — MacBook` (or `Cursor agent`).
   - Key type: **Authentication Key**.
   - Paste the **single line** from `.pub`.
3. Confirm access:  
   `ssh -i ~/.ssh/agentic_ai_github/id_ed25519 -T git@github.com`  
   Expect: `Hi <username>! You've successfully authenticated...`

**Org / repo policies:** If the org enforces SSO, **authorize** this key for the org on the key’s GitHub page. For restricted repos, the GitHub user that owns this key needs **write** access.

## SSH config (recommended): host alias `github.com-agentic-ai`

Append to **`~/.ssh/config`** (create the file if missing; `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config`):

```sshconfig
# Dedicated key for Agentic AI / automation (see agentic_ai_context/GITHUB_AGENTIC_AI_SSH.md)
Host github.com-agentic-ai
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/agentic_ai_github/id_ed25519
    IdentitiesOnly yes
```

Then use **SSH remote URLs** with that host:

```bash
# Example: clone
git clone git@github.com-agentic-ai:TrueSightDAO/agentic_ai_context.git

# Example: fix remote in existing repo
git remote set-url origin git@github.com-agentic-ai:TrueSightDAO/your-repo.git
```

## One-off push without changing `origin`

From the repo directory:

```bash
GIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh -i ~/.ssh/agentic_ai_github/id_ed25519 -o IdentitiesOnly=yes' git push origin main
```

Replace `main` with your branch.

## Passphrase

The generated key may use an **empty passphrase** so agents can push without interactive prompts. That is convenient and **higher risk** if the private key file is copied. To harden: regenerate with `ssh-keygen` and a passphrase, then load the key into **ssh-agent** / macOS Keychain for the session.

## Regenerating

If the key is compromised or rotated:

```bash
rm ~/.ssh/agentic_ai_github/id_ed25519 ~/.ssh/agentic_ai_github/id_ed25519.pub
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/agentic_ai_github/id_ed25519 -C "agentic-ai-github-TrueSightDAO"
```

Remove the old public key from GitHub, add the new `.pub`, update any CI references.

## Pull requests — branch-first workflow (agents)

**Convention for any codebase the agent edits and pushes:** do **not** push directly to `main` (or the default production branch) unless the user explicitly orders it.

1. **`git fetch`** the remote and branch from an up-to-date default branch (usually `main` / `master`).
2. **Create a new branch** per change set, with a clear prefix, e.g. `feature/…`, `fix/…`, `docs/…`, `seo/…`. **Do not push whatever local branch you happen to be on** (e.g. stale names like `schema_update`, `conversion_planner`, `agentic_ai_followups`) unless that branch was created **for this task** from the current default branch with a name that describes the work (e.g. `feature/email-agent-followup-body-plain`). If the workspace checkout is on an unrelated branch, **`git checkout main`** (or the repo default), **`git pull`**, then **`git checkout -b feature/<short-topic>`** before committing.
3. **Commit** with a clear subject and body: *what* changed, *why*, how to verify, risks, rollback hints.
4. **`git push -u origin <branch>`** using **`GIT_SSH_COMMAND`** or the **`github.com-agentic-ai`** host (see above).
5. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub (web UI or `gh pr create` if available). The PR description must stand alone for human reviewers:
   - **Goal** — one sentence.
   - **Changes** — bullet list of files/areas.
   - **Testing** — what was run (e.g. `npm test`, `npm run sitemap`, manual checks).
   - **Rollout / follow-ups** — Sheets, clasp, env, or anything not in git.
6. **Merge** — leave to **human reviewers by default**. If the user **explicitly** asks to “merge into main / master” (or the default branch) after opening a PR, the agent may finish the loop: confirm CI with **at most one non-blocking snapshot** (e.g. **`gh pr checks`**, **`gh pr view --json statusCheckRollup`**, or the user says checks are green)—**do not** run long **`gh pr checks --watch`** / **`gh run watch`** loops—then merge via **`gh pr merge`** (prefer **`--merge`** or **`--squash`** according to repo convention; use **`--delete-branch`** when the team prefers it) or the GitHub web UI. Prefer running the same tests **locally** when feasible (`npm test`, Playwright, etc.). Document what shipped in the PR body before merging. See **`WORKSPACE_CONTEXT.md` §3e**.

### When the user requests the full release loop

If they ask to push recent work, open a PR, **and merge to default branch** in one go:

1. **`git fetch`** and **`git checkout`** / **`git pull`** the default branch (`main` or `master`).
2. **Create a dated, scoped branch** (e.g. `feature/YYYY-MM-DD-short-topic`).
3. **Stage only intentional paths** — exclude `__pycache__/`, local credentials, `.env`, and large binaries unless the repo is meant to host them.
4. **Commit** with a clear message; **push** using **`GIT_SSH_COMMAND`** or **`github.com-agentic-ai`** (see above).
5. **`gh pr create`** (or web) with **Goal**, **Changes**, **Testing**, **Rollout**.
6. **`gh pr merge`** (or web) **only when the user explicitly asked to merge** and checks are green (one **`gh pr checks`** snapshot or local tests)—**not** after long polling on GitHub; otherwise stop at step 5. See **`WORKSPACE_CONTEXT.md` §3e**.

The compare URL is usually:

`https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/compare/<base>...<branch>?expand=1`

Replace `<base>` with the default branch name the repo uses.

## Workflow files (.github/workflows/) — SSH required

GitHub **Personal Access Tokens** (both classic and fine-grained) require the **`workflow`** scope to create or update files under `.github/workflows/`. If your PAT lacks this scope, the Contents API (`upload_file_to_github`) and `git push` over HTTPS will both fail with a 403.

**Fix:** Use SSH instead.

```bash
# Clone via SSH
git clone git@github.com:TrueSightDAO/Cypher-Defense.git

# Or use GIT_SSH_COMMAND with the agentic_ai_github key
GIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh -i ~/.ssh/agentic_ai_github/id_ed25519 -o IdentitiesOnly=yes' git push origin master
```

**Fallback host:** If the agentic_ai_github key isn't on the current machine, use `seni_ror` (Edgar's Rails server) which has Gary's personal SSH key:

```bash
ssh seni_ror "cd /tmp && git clone git@github.com:TrueSightDAO/Cypher-Defense.git && ..."
```

This is what the autopilot did for the security-dashboard-daily.yml workflow (2026-06-04).

## For AI agents (Cursor, etc.)

When the user asks you to **push to GitHub** and this machine should use the automation key:

1. Prefer remotes using **`git@github.com-agentic-ai:`** after the user has added the `Host` block above, **or**
2. Use **`GIT_SSH_COMMAND`** as shown, with **`~/.ssh/agentic_ai_github/id_ed25519`**.

Follow **§ Pull requests — branch-first workflow** above unless the user explicitly requests a direct push to default branch.

Confirm the remote is **SSH**, not HTTPS (`https://github.com/...`), or the SSH key will not apply.
