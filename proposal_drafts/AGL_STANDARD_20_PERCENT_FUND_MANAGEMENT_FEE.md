## Summary

Proposal to **standardize the fund management fee to 20%** for all **future** AGL (Agroverse Ledger) contracts. This aligns with common practice in venture capital and hedge funds and gives the DAO a single, transparent rate for managing capital and operations on AGL shipment/ledger contracts.

---

## Background

- **AGL contracts** are per-shipment or per-partner ledgers (e.g. AGL1, AGL2) that track inventory, capital, and transactions. The DAO provides fund management, operations, and reporting.
- Fee structures have historically been agreed on a case-by-case basis. Standardizing for **future** contracts reduces negotiation overhead and sets clear expectations for both the DAO and partners.

---

## Proposed change

- **Standard fee:** **20%** fund management fee for all **new** AGL contracts entered into after this proposal is approved.
- **Scope:** Applies only to **future** AGL contracts. Existing contracts remain under their current terms unless otherwise amended by mutual agreement.
- **Definition:** “Fund management fee” means the DAO’s fee for managing capital, inventory, and operations on the AGL ledger (e.g. percentage of managed capital or revenue as defined in each contract, with the **rate** fixed at 20%).

---

## Rationale

1. **Industry alignment** — 20% is familiar in VC (carried interest) and hedge fund management fees, making it easy to explain and compare.
2. **Simplicity** — One rate for all new deals reduces ambiguity and speeds up onboarding of new AGL partners.
3. **Sustainability** — Ensures the DAO is compensated consistently for operational and management work across AGL ledgers.
4. **Transparency** — Public, voted policy so partners and members know the default terms up front.

---

## Implementation

- Once passed, the 20% standard shall be reflected in:
  - New AGL contract templates and partner agreements.
  - Internal governance/operations documentation (e.g. agentic_ai_context, tokenomics docs) so future contracts and automation reference this standard.
- Existing AGL contracts are **unchanged** unless revised by separate agreement.

---

## Request

DAO members are asked to vote **YES** to adopt the 20% standard fund management fee for all future AGL contracts, or **NO** to reject. Amendments (e.g. a different rate or carve-outs) can be proposed in a follow-up proposal.

*Draft prepared for DAO vote. After publishing, the proposal will follow the usual review (3–5 business days) and 7-day voting period per [GOVERNANCE_SOURCES.md](../GOVERNANCE_SOURCES.md).*
